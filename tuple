# Because of tuple is immutable we cannot update items of tuple. If we want to update items, firstly convert tuple into list, update items and again conert list into tuple
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
#converting tuple into list
y = list(x)
# update items
y[1] = "kiwi"
# converting list into tuple

x = tuple(y)

print(x)
